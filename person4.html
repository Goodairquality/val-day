            <p>Hey, pooks! I still find it funny how you thought I hated you last year in robotics,
              and now you are one of my closest friends (lmao) anyways, I just wanna thank you for 
              always being so caring and kind to me, making me laugh, and just always being there for 
              me (ugh sappy I know but its valentines day so deal w it !!) I also admire how outgoing 
              you are. I feel that spending time with you has allowed me to break out of my shell and 
              do things I otherwise never would have done because I was too reserved. You're also the 
              reason I'm more confident in myself today compared to the last 2 years of my life. I'm 
              very grateful to have a friend like you and I wouldn't trade anything in the world for 
              my relationship with you. There's more that I could say that I just can't properly express 
              with words but I just want you to know you've changed my life and me for the better.
              for now, enjoy this song <3</p>
