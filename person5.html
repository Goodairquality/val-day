            <p>Hey Ava, I know we don't know each other too well, but I still want to take a moment to appreciate you. 
              From the times we interacted, I can tell you are very intelligent, especially emotionally, and that's something 
              I really admire about you! I also like that we have some things in common like the games we play yk? I hope we
               get the chance to talk more in the future if you're down! Happy Valentine's Day!</p>
