            <p>Hey Ryan, you're a chill guy. Lwk is racist, 
              but still a chill guy, and yk what? It could be worse. 
              I respect you, man. I'm also glad to see that you don't 
              like the creatures that Aishani seems to like so much. I 
              respect that. Glad to know you got eyes! Happy Valentine's 
              Day! (idk what music you listen to so uh just pretend you like it !)</p>
