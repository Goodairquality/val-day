            <p>Hi chat, just wanna let you know that I appreciate you. 
              You care about everyone at the table group and it really shows. 
              It's also nice to have another West African friend that I can 
              relate to a bit. Keep being positive, dont worry about what other people think, and you'll
              do great in anything you put your mind to (idk your music taste too well mb gang !). 
              Hope you have a great Valentine's Day! 
              (Also, You're not beating me in sf btw, TRY ME !!!)</p>
