            <p>Hey, girly pop! I just want you to know I'm very grateful to have you as a friend. 
                I love talking to you on Instagram about literally anything like the missy edit on tiktok and how we both related to how she felt (tragic&lt;/3)  and honestly, you give really good advice like actually. 
                Youve changed my view on a lot of things especially school and grades like not stresing over them tew much bc when is anyone gonna ask for my GPA after highschool? 
                (Im still stubborn w it but im getting there trust) Yk what else? I love how focused and outspoken you are when it comes to God you know? 
                I need to get like you fr. Youre also probably one of the funniest people I know and i just generally enjoy your company chat. 
                Youre also the main reason the English table exists and I honestly could not thank you more for bringing us all together. 
                I'm especially grateful since this is my first time having like a group of friends around me you know? 
                I'm very grateful to be friends with all of you guys and I'm grateful to you for bringing us all together. 
                Keep shining brightly, keep working hard, and don't get hungover on someone not responding. 
                If something is meant for you it will come to you <3</p>
