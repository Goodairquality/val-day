            <p>Hey! I hope you know you my favorite biggy, coconut, and one of my favorite people. 
              Even if your taste in men is questionable and concerning at best, 
              i enjoy hearing you yap about your obsessions with these creatures! Jokes lmao. But I actually do like talking with you, 
              but ngl ive probably talked to you less than the amount of reels youve sent me (read a book babes!) Jokes again! 
              Anyways, thanks for just always being there, you know? Like, i have someone to yap with almost every class period. 
              Lowkey, would hate to sit through 2 of Mr.marquez’s classes alone and bored, yk? I'd go insane. Last, I lowkey thought 
              about getting you some vaseline for your DRY hands, but I was like, “hm nah, she would hit me,” so I got you candy instead!
               Wow!!</p>
