            <p>Hey danzel! Hope you're doing well teehee! 
              Lol fr though I just wanna say thanks for being so 
              sweet and caring to me! You're one of the funniest people 
              I know and super talented too like hello??? Davinchi who? 
              I was really disappointed how this year we didn't have any 
              classes together but I'm glad we still get to see each other 
              in the mornings and after school. Even if this year wasn't 
              like last year at the French table, I still enjoy spending 
              time with all of you guys. I'm grateful that Mrs. Fanny brought 
              us all together and brought you to us! 
              Happy Valentine's day Danzel!</p>
